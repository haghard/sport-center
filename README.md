Sport Center
================
SportCenter is a POC reactive applications based on microservices architecture built on top of [Akka](akka.io) following a Event Sourcing based approach.

### Reactive application, Event Sourcing, Microservice architecture what and why shortly ###
Event Sourcing is about capturing sequence of event in journal. Each transaction/event is being recorded. State is recreated by replaying all the transactions/events.

### DataStore

This application requires a distributed journal. Storage backends for journals and snapshot stores are pluggable in Akka persistence. In this case we are using MongoDB.
You can find other journal plugins [here](http://akka.io/community/?_ga=1.264939791.1443869017.1408561680).
The journal is specified in **application.conf**

### About the project ###

This application uses a simple domain to demonstrate CQRS and event sourcing with Akka Persistence. This domain is a nba games: results and standings

There are 3 type roles node in our akka cluster 
* Gateway:  Group of machines that links together two worlds using simple Load Balancer and Distributed Service Registry for internal cluster nodes. Every incoming request will be redirected for internal services if matched route is found. Each Gateway node provides following features:
`Fault tolerant request routing layer` using [Hystrix]( http://hystrix.github.com). To deliver fault tolerance Hystrix has built in the following features:
timeout for every request to an external system, limit of concurrent requests for external system, circuit breaker to avoid further requests, retry of a single request after circuit breaker has triggered, realtime aggregated dashboard for to retrieve runtime information on load 
`Distributed CRDT based Distributed Service Registry` for domain using [akka-data-replication](https://github.com/patriknw/akka-data-replication). Every cluster node (exclude Gateways) before start register itself in Service Registry for being available for further requests
`Akka-Cluster for distributed cluster membership`
  
* Crawlers:  Cluster nodes to collect result from web. Deployed http route: `http://{ip}:{port}/api/crawler`
`Akka-Cluster for distributed cluster membership`
  
* Domain:  Loosely coupled command or query side microservice with sharded domain. We use Akka-Http, Akka-Persistense and Akka-Sharding to achieve this. Each Domain node is a place for one or several shards of the domain. Domain itself is a set of Persistent Actors.
One Persistent Actor for one team. Every Game Persistent Actor persists incoming events in Event Journal (Mongo in own case) and updates own state.
Domain node by itself could be 2 kinds **query-side-results** with routes [`http://{ip}:{port}/api/results/{dt}` and `http://{ip}:{port}/api/results/{team}/last`] and **query-side-standing** `http://{ip}:{port}/api/standings/{dt}`. They are both processes that can serve read queries. If gateway layer ran we can start and stop as many as we want **query-side-results** and **query-side-standing** processes to increase read throughput. We assume that our materialized views is so small that each machine can hold a copy of it in memory. This allows query side to be completely based on memory, and don't perform any request to the underlying db. We use `PersistentView` concept that acts like a streamer for persisted events. What interesting there is what we can stay responsive with lost up to n-1 one of every type `Query-side-nnn` node.

### How to run ###


1. Install and run mongo.
2. Modify file **application.conf** `casbah-journal.mongo-journal-url`, `casbah-snapshot-store.mongo-snapshot-url` with your own.
3. Run local gateway layer using `sbt lgateway0` and or `lgateway1` `lgateway2`. All running configurations can be found in /sportcenter/bootstrap/build.sbt. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4. Run local crawler `sbt lcrawler0`
5. Run local query-side-results `sbt lresults0`
6. Run local query-side-standing `sbt lstandings0`. At least 3 node(1 crawler + 1 gateway + 1 results/standings) should be started to form cluster and begin crawling

For testing we can use this: `http GET {ip}:2561/routes`, `http GET {ip}:2561/api/results/2013-01-29`, `http GET {ip}:2561/api/results/okc/last`, `http GET {ip}:2561/api/standings/2013-01-28`
